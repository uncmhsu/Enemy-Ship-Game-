# Enemy-Ship-Game-
Java Factory Design Pattern Practice

There are multiple ways that I wrote this game to practice using the Java Factory Design Pattern.

1.) The first way I wrote the game was without using the factory design pattern, and the repository at this point in history can be found at this link: https://github.com/uncmhsu/Enemy-Ship-Game-/tree/64a1f2608572154f77efb28087ae8b893f25cb2e
2.) The second way I wrote the game was with a very basic factory design pattern implementation, and the repository at this point in history can be found here:

3.) Finally, the most recent version of the game successfully utilizes the Factory Design Pattern dynamic subclass binding method. This also was very helpful in condensing the amount of code and files I needed to use to make the game.
